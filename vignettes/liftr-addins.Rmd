# RStudio addins to the rescue

If you use RStudio, there is a good chance that you love the
`Knit` button that will give you the power of one-click R Markdown document compilation. Luckily, we also prepared four RStudio addins that supports
containerizing and rendering your documents with liftr.

# Addin: 📦 Containerize

This addin helps you generate the `Dockerfile` for the current
R Markdown document opened in RStudio (with liftr meta),
using `lift()`.

# Addin: 🎉 Render

This addin will generate the `Dockerfile` based on the document,
create the Docker container, and render the document inside the
container using `render_docker()`.

# Addin: ✂️ Prune Dangling

Sometimes the Docker image build fails due to various reasons,
this addin will help you clean up the unused dangling containers
and images automatically.

# Addin: 🗑 Remove Image

After having a satisfying rendered document, maybe you would
not need the Docker image for rendering the document for a long time.
This addin helps you remove that particular Docker image.
