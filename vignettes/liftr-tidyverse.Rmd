# Introduction

Creating Docker images from scratch can be time and labor consuming.
Fortunately, many pre-built and regularly updated Docker images
for the R community are ready for use, especially when creating
your own containerized R Markdown documents with liftr.

Such sources of pre-built Docker images include the 
[rocker project](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) and
[Bioconductor Docker containers](https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/).
In this article, we will use the [tidyverse image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse/)
provided by rocker. This image includes the essential tidyverse packages
and devtools environment loved by many data scientists [@wickham2014tidy].
We will demonstrate how to containerize and render your tidyverse-heavy
R Markdown document using Docker in only a few minutes.

# Install Docker

If Docker has not been installed on your system, please use `install_docker()`
and follow the guidelines to install it. After that, `check_docker_install()`
and `check_docker_running()` would help you make sure that Docker has been
installed and running properly.

# Example document

Let's create a new folder first and copy the example R Markdown document
to this folder:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
path = paste0("~/liftr-tidyverse/")

dir.create(path)
file.copy(system.file("examples/liftr-tidyverse.Rmd", package = "liftr"), path)

input = paste0(path, "liftr-tidyverse.Rmd")
```

If we open the R Markdown file, we will see the header section
includes a `liftr` section, which defines the Docker system
environment required to render this document. For our case,
it is very straightforward and simple indeed:

```yaml

title: "Explore tidyverse with liftr"
author: "Nan Xiao <<me@nanx.me>>"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  rmarkdown::pdf_document:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
liftr:
  from: "rocker/tidyverse:latest"
  maintainer: "Nan Xiao"
  email: "me@nanx.me"
  pandoc: false
  texlive: true
  cran:
    - nycflights13
---
```

Most of the fields are self-explanatory:

- Here we simply specified the latest `rocker/tidyverse` image as our
base image, which would save us a lot of time creating a custom
base image with all the tidyverse dependencies.
- The custom `pandoc` installation was not included because the
tidyverse image already includes `pandoc`.
- We included TeXLive here since we intend to render a PDF file in the end.
- The CRAN data package `nycflights13` will be installed.

# Containerize the document

Let's containerize this document by generating a `Dockerfile` for it,
using `liftr::lift`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lift(input)
```

A file named `Dockerfile` will be generated under the same directory
of the input RMD file. It contains the necessary commands for building
the Docker container for rendering the document.

# Render the document

We can use `render_docker()` to start the Docker container,
and render the document inside it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
render_docker(input)
```

Let's view the rendered document:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseURL(paste0(path, "liftr-tidyverse.pdf"))
```

In the last section of the rendered PDF, we will see that the session
information are probably different with your current system's information.
Yes, that is because the document is completed generated by
a newly built, isolated Linux system environment, using Docker.

In this way, the R Markdown document gains a higher, system level
reproducibility, thus easily replicable by other users who might not
have the identical system and R package environment to yours.
This is a good thing for team collaboration and large-scale document
orchestration. The best part is, all you need to share is still the
document itself, only with a few extra metadata fields.

# Housekeeping

The Docker images stored in your system could take a few gigabytes
and get larger gradually as you build more images. Let's remove
the generated Docker image to save some disk space:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
prune_image(paste0(path, "liftr-tidyverse.docker.yml"))
```

If we do this, the Docker container will be rebuilt next time
when you use `render_docker()`. If not, the image will be cached
in the system and reused when compiling the document later
and save some time for you.
